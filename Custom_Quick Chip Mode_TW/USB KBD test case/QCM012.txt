Objective: 
[JIRA] GRN-56 >> [Quick Chip Mode] Swiped card (service code = 201) -> waited for fallback transaction timeout, reader returned timeout status but LED 3 was still ON.
[JIRA] GRN-60 >> [Quick Chip Mode] Fallback to chip reader -> swiped IDT test card, reader can read the card.

>>> Set CT terminal data = 5C (enable MSR fallback to CT function)

>>> Fallback to CT transaction
SWIPEKB: click OK -> swipe Discover card -> waited 30 sec fallback timeout.

MESSAGECK: LED 3 is ON (steady status) if fallback to chip reader, LED 3 is OFF if fallback timeout

>>> Fallback to CT transaction
SWIPEKB: click OK -> swipe Discover card -> swipe any MSR test card -> waited 30 sec fallback timeout.
